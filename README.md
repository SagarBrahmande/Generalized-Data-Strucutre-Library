Developed a command-line research application enabling users to create and manage custom 
  template libraries.
• All the object-oriented designing policies are used in this project.
• Provided readymade implementations of all fundamental operations as well as advanced 
operations on linear, nonlinear data structures in an object-oriented way.
• Provide a generic way of implementation so we can use the functionality for any type of data 
types.
• This library provides a unified interface for common data structures, facilitating ease of use and 
integration into different projects.
